// Requirements:
// Modify the existing Task Manager module to incorporate the Observer Pattern.
// Create a User class representing users who observe changes in the task list.
// Each user should have a name property.
// The User class should have an update method that logs changes in the task list, including the user's name.
// When a task is added, completed, or removed from the task list, all observers (users) should be notified of the changes.
// Ensure that users can be added and removed as observers from the task manager.
// Export the User class from a separate user.js module.
// Test the functionality by creating instances of the TaskManager and User classes, adding users as observers, 
// and performing various operations on the task list.
